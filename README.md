# Cross and noughts prototype
 I learn Unity so i decided to make a simple game with a simple gameplay. This game is already fully playable.
 Features I've already done:
 1. Core gameplay
 2. Settings for grid's size (up to 10x10), players count (up to 8), squares in a row filled to win and so on.
 3. Bots' AI with different difficulty levels and different possible behavior
 4. Possibility of adding "skins" for symbols.
